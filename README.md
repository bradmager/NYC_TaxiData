## NYC Taxi Data for June 2015

In August 2015, the NYC Taxi and Limosine Commission released taxi data up through June 2015. This project analyzes some of that data, which is available at: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml. Due to the large size of the files, I chose to just look at the data for June 2015, though of course the analysis could be extended to other months.

There are two main parts to this project: Answering several questions about the data, and creating a visual representation of the pickup and dropoff locations of the taxis.

The coding was done in an iPython notebook, and output to a PDF file for ease of viewing.
